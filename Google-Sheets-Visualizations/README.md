# Google Sheets Sales Visualization by Division

## Overview
This project contains visualizations created in **Google Sheets** to analyze sales data across different divisions (East, West, North, and South). The goal is to provide insights into the sales performance of each division through various types of charts.

The following visualizations are included in the project:

## Visualizations

### 1. Total Sales by Division (Pie Chart)
This **Pie Chart** displays the total sales contribution from each division (East, West, North, and South). The chart provides a clear visual representation of how each division contributes to the overall sales total.

- **Key Insight**: This helps identify the largest and smallest sales contributors among the four divisions.

### 2. Division Sales by Month (Line Chart)
This **Line Chart** shows sales for each division (East, West, North, South) over a series of months. The chart allows us to track the sales performance trend for each division and compare their monthly sales.

- **Key Insight**: This chart helps visualize seasonal fluctuations and trends over time across different divisions.

### 3. Percent Change in Sales by Division (Bar Chart)
This **Bar Chart** illustrates the **percent change in sales** for each division. It shows both positive and negative changes in sales, with losses depicted using a **backward red color**. This highlights the divisions that have experienced a decrease in sales.

- **Key Insight**: This chart provides a clear view of which divisions have been struggling or performing well, highlighting areas needing attention.
